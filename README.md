=======================

MCS is a tool that exploits the Monte Carlo method and, with a complex algorithm based on the PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique), it estimates a project's time.
MCS is a opensource project and it was devolped by Java Programming Language.

Application build
=================

Some notes follow about the build process :

JAR file generation
-------------------

jar file can be generated running

    mvn package

a jar including all dependencies packed in the same jar can be generated by running

    mvn package -Pbundle

Testing
=======

The next properties can be used to parametrize the test behaviour :

BetaCalculatorTest
------------------
* mcs.tests.bc.random-max : max. number of tests (default : 1000)
* mcs.tests.bc.random-max-dist : max. number of probability function points generated (default : 100)
